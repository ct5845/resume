## Interests, Hobbies
### Rowing
#### Coaching 2016-2021
I've coached the Women's Squad at the City of Bristol Rowing Club for the past 5 years (though only 3 active seasons due to COVID!).  
ee 2013-2020). We've gone from a squad of 9 and not qualifying for the Club 8+s and Henley Womens Regatta,
to a squad of 50, and finalists. We train/coach 6-7 days a week, October-July.
#### Trustee 2014-2020
I've also been a trustee of the club for 6 years, taking on roles as Mens' captain, Vice-Captain, Club Captain, and finally Chairman.

### Cycling
An all-weather commuter, but a pure fair-weather "roadie". I've cycled as a side-hobby for 10 years now, but have recently started to take
this up a gear, in 2020 - I went from 'sofa fit' to Everesting in 3 months! Will I do it again? I think I've got the itch...
